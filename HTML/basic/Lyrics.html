      Every night in my dreams
      I see you, I feel you
      That is how I know you go on
      Far across the distance
      And spaces between us
      You have come to show you go on

      Near, far, wherever you are
      I believe that the heart does go on
      Once more, you open the door
      And you're here in my heart
      And my heart will go on and on

      Love can touch us one time
      And last for a lifetime
      And never let go 'til we're gone
      Love was when I loved you
      One true time I'd hold to
      In my life, we'll always go on

      Near, far, wherever you are
      I believe that the heart does go on
      (Why does the heart go on?)
      Once more, you open the door
      And you're here in my heart
      And my heart will go on and on

      You're here, there's nothing I fear
      And I know that my heart will go on
      We'll stay forever this way
      You are safe in my heart
      And my heart will go on and on

      Mm, mm-mm
